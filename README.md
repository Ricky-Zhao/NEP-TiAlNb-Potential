Dear colleague,

Thank you very much for your interest in our work. 
However, due to an ongoing and highly relevant follow-up project, we are not publicly sharing the training dataset at this time. 
Once the project is completed, we plan to make it available.

In the meantime, you may want to check out another one of our works,(General-purpose machine-learned potential for 16 elemental metals and their alloys;Nature Communications 15 (1), 10208), 
for which the training dataset has already been made public. 

Best regards,

Zhiqiang
